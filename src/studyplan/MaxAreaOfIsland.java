//You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) 
//connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) 
//You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
//
//The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.
//
//Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.
//
//Constraints:
//	m == grid.length
//	n == grid[i].length
//	1 <= m, n <= 50
//	grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
